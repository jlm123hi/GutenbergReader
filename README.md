# GutenbergReader
A fast python program to read books from Project Gutenberg for word frequency.

# Instructions
The book you are searching must be a plain text file in the same directory as the script.

If you would like to check it against a dictionary, you must also have a file called wordlist.txt in the same folder.

This program assumes everything to be encoded in UTF-8.
